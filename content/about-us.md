## About Us
Kulawe Limited is a consultancy and training company. We specialise in the Scrum project management framework and the git  version control tool.

Kulawe Limited was founded in 2010 by a group of senior engineers each with over 13 years experience. Over that time we have solved problems in domains as diverse as mobile phone applications, robotics, banking, games, embedded systems, healthcare, high performance computing, e-commerce and simulation.

Having worked with many diverse teams over the years we now focus on helping organisations and teams improve their development processes. Helping them to deliver better quality products faster.
We achieve this in two ways: 

* Firstly we work with the teams directly to introduce them to the Scrum project management framework. Or for those teams that are already using Scrum we examine their process and suggest how it can be improved.

* Secondly we train the team members in the advanced techniques they need to become more productive. Initially we are focusing on improving how teams use version control, with other areas to follow. 

Kulawe Limited has a headquarters in Belfast, Northern Ireland, with a satellite office in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. Kulawe works with clients around the world.

## How do I pronounce and what does it mean?
"Koo-La-Wee". The word Kulawe means... well, only our customers know the answer to that!
