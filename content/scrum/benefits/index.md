## What are the Benefits? ##

We at Kulawe have seen the following benefits of moving to a Scrum process.

* Our customers are more satisfied with the final product.
* Our customers have greater visibility of the product. They see regular incremental improvements in the product during development.
* Our customers experience closer collaboration during development. This increases visibility of the state of the project at any point in time.
* Our customer see a reduced time-to-market, with a higher value product.
* Our team, and the teams we work with become more productive.
* Our team, and the teams we work with produce a higher quality product.
* Everyone is more engaged in the project which leads to increased job satisfaction.
