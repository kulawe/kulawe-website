Hello, and welcome to the new Kulawe company blog.
We have decided to include a blog as 
<!--more-->
part of the recent website redesign. We wanted to have a space where we could 
talk about developments at Kulawe, as well as talk about the common 
problems our clients face and their solutions. 

We are currently discussing a number of future topics for the blog. These include:
 
* How we redesigned the website. The new website is actually automatically 
 generated, using some custom software that continues to evolve.

* Website and mobile application security. The website redesign threw up an
 interesting security question, which we needed to solve.

* Using an agile approach for project management. We see a lot of software
 projects failing to deliver, due to a common set of assumptions and mistakes.

* Designing mobile applications. Mobile applications are significantly
 different from websites. In order to be successful clients need to approach
 the task with fresh eyes.

We plan to grow Kulawe into new and interesting areas during the course of
2013. That news will appear here in the blog through out the year.
 
A Happy New Year to both our existing and future clients.
