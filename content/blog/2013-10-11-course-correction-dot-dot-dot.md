### A change of direction for Kulawe

The world is changing, and so is our business. Over the course of the past year
 we have seen more of our clients move in two distinct directions.

<!--more-->

Firstly, we have see a move towards agile development methods and the scrum 
project management framework.

Secondly, we have seen a large shift away from traditional source code 
management solutions towards git, which is a modern distributed source code management tool.

Our work coaching agile teams and training developers how to use git, is now 
the fastest growing part of our business. As a result of this we, as a company,
 have started a course correction. 

Going forward we intend to concentrate solely on these two areas. As a result 
we will be stepping back from any future bespoke software development work. 
The future of our web site monitoring solution remains undecided at this point.

Over the coming days and weeks we will begin the process of transitioning our 
website to reflect our new identity and direction.

We look forward to the journey.
