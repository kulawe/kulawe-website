We are pleased to announce that our new Website Monitoring Service is now
available. This is the first of a series of website security tools that we will 
be releasing this year.
<!--more-->
Following the attack against our website in 2012, we are now offering a website
security service based on some of our internal tools. The first of these 
services is our Website Monitoring Service.

The Website Monitoring Service provides an early warning if your site is being
used to host and distribute malware. This is a tactic often used by hackers to 
infect the computers of visitors to your website. This protects you and your
customers.

The service will also guard against the loss of SEO ranks, by preventing the
blacklisting of your site by search engines.

Should the worse happen, we will remove the malware and return you website to 
fully functional state. Malware cleanup is included as part of the service.

If you would like to know more, full details of the service can be found on our
new [Website Monitoring](/website-monitoring/) page.
