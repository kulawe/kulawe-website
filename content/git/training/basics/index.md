### Prerequisites 
Participants are expected to have some knowledge of the command line prior to participation.

The course requires that a git server exists. This can be achieved in one of
two ways. We can provide a git server as a virtual machine image. This images
will require suitable hardware being available to host it. The image will also
require some necessary post install configuration in the form of the setting up
users. Alternatively one of the many cloud based git hosting services can be
used. We can advise you on the benefits of the various hosted solutions
available.
