## Git Consulting

In addition to our git training courses we offer a specialist consulting service.

You may have a specific problem that you require help with, or you may require
additional support services, or help in integrating our git server solution with
your existing systems, or changes to our git server solution. Our consulting
service is provided for these situations.

Typical problems that we have been asked to solve in the past include:

* Migration to git from other source code management solutions
* Splitting large existing git repositories into a series of smaller
 repositories
* Combining a series of small git repositories into a single larger git
 repository
* Upgrading git systems to newer versions
* Linking git to continuous integration systems
* Linking git to bug tracking systems
* Linking git to Application Lifecycle Management solutions such as Microsoft's Team Foundation Server.
* Enforcing a particular form or style of commit messages
* Automatic deployment by a continuous integration solution from git
* Automatic generation of release notes
* Automatic generation and display of project and code base statistics
* Purging files permanently from a repository
* Using git for component based environment - this is typical in larger
 enterprises who deliver solutions as a series of interdependent components
* Linking git with dependency management solutions.

Please [contact us](/contact-us/) if you require our more specialised services
and we will be happy to discuss your needs with you.

We are happy to provide a quote on a per job basis or provide support at a hourly rate for a fixed period, as suits your needs.
