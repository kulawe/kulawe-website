* [Git Training](/git/training/) Our git training courses are appropriate if you and your organisation are about to, or have just started to use git. Our training courses will help you get the most return from your investment in the tool.
* [Git Consulting](/git/consulting/) Our consultancy service is more appropriate if you have not yet moved to git and simply want some advice. Or if you are already an established git user and want to improve your processes or integrate git with other systems.

### Version Control Systems Background
A version control is a system that records changes to a set of files, allowing you to go back to a specific version at a later date. This is useful if you make a mistake and need to undo it, even if you have overwritten the file.  Or you may want to see the changes made and by whom over time. 

Originally used by Software Engineers they can be used by web designers or anyone who needs to archive files or documents.

Any type of file can be placed under version control. It is most often used to store software source code, but graphics or website layouts or office documents can all be stored.

At Kulawe we store our website graphics and pages, our company documentation and all of our software source code.
